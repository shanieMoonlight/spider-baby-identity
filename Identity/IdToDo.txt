Document IDMessageing better

 HANGFIRE: 
 Documentation: You must clearly document the required call order for the consuming application: app.UseRouting() must be called before app.UseMyId() for ASP.NET Core 3.0+ applications to ensure the MapHangfireDashboard route is used.
Hangfire Storage: You need to decide how the Hangfire storage is configured. In the example, I've added a hangfireConfiguration Action to AddMyId() to allow the consumer to provide the storage (e.g., SQL Server, Redis, etc.), as this is usually application-specific.
